Hello Herr Rutzel - hope you are well! Nice to see you around. I would like to follow up on the washing machine topic. I called Reddy Kuchen, and also Frau Dominguez, and the advice was to come back to you.
Please see below for some pictures of the kitchen for easy reference:
	1) As you see, there is a wall column between the sink and potential area for the machine. I noted that from the front, there seems a thick frame, by knocking on it, but from the side, I seem to hear that it's hollow.
	2) Reddy Kuchen advised that I should contract either a store like MediaMarkt or an independent handyman for the work. My understanding is that the job is not so simple; what MediaMarkt will offer to do as part of their "Einbau" service, I do not believe our requirements are in scope.
	3) Frau Dominguez did suggest that you would be best placed to offer ideas and recommendations and how best to move forward.
Apologies for the long message. We are very keen, we are expecting a newborn at the end of the year! 
Look forward to your feedback, hope you have a wonderful evening!
